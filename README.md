# Optus Coding Challenge

Make a Progress bar app using React, Typescript good practices.
I'm going to take this as an opportunity to use Vite templates to quickly pull together some SSR, and figure out how to use vitest instead of jest to write my tests.

## Steps taken:

`npm create vite@latest`
` - create-vite-extra`
` - ssr-react`
` - TypeScript + SWC`

- Lock down the node version with a .nvmrc file
- Deploy to vercel https://optus-challenge.vercel.app/
- Then make Vitest run a basic test
